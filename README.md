Shock lest shackles free you

Volt face cons

Abandon you again

I won't feel, not this time

Shock lest shackles free you

Volt face cons

Abandon you again

I won't feel, not this time, oh, yeah

Brick by brick the night eclipsed pricked by cuticle thorns

Dried the sleep of nursery slits into this life I'm born

Heaven's just a scab away

I'd like to see you after just one taste

Oh, oh, oh

Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight

Night forevermore

Let them see it has begun

The others I've become
